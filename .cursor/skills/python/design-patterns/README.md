# Design Patterns (Detailed)

Each file describes one pattern with **when to use it**, **structure**, and **Python code examples**.

## Creational — how objects are created

| Pattern | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|
| Singleton | [creational/singleton.md](creational/singleton.md) | Single shared instance |
| Factory Method | [creational/factory-method.md](creational/factory-method.md) | Delegate creation to subclasses |
| Abstract Factory | [creational/abstract-factory.md](creational/abstract-factory.md) | Families of related objects |
| Builder | [creational/builder.md](creational/builder.md) | Step-by-step construction |
| Prototype | [creational/prototype.md](creational/prototype.md) | Clone instead of creating from scratch |

## Structural — how objects are composed

| Pattern | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|
| Adapter | [structural/adapter.md](structural/adapter.md) | Adapt one interface to another |
| Bridge | [structural/bridge.md](structural/bridge.md) | Separate abstraction from implementation |
| Composite | [structural/composite.md](structural/composite.md) | Tree of objects treated uniformly |
| Decorator | [structural/decorator.md](structural/decorator.md) | Add behavior by wrapping |
| Facade | [structural/facade.md](structural/facade.md) | Simple interface to a subsystem |
| Flyweight | [structural/flyweight.md](structural/flyweight.md) | Share state to save memory |
| Proxy | [structural/proxy.md](structural/proxy.md) | Placeholder with controlled access |

## Behavioral — how objects interact

| Pattern | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------|
| Chain of Responsibility | [behavioral/chain-of-responsibility.md](behavioral/chain-of-responsibility.md) | Pass request along a chain of handlers |
| Command | [behavioral/command.md](behavioral/command.md) | Encapsulate request as object |
| Iterator | [behavioral/iterator.md](behavioral/iterator.md) | Traverse a collection without exposing internals |
| Mediator | [behavioral/mediator.md](behavioral/mediator.md) | Central object for object interactions |
| Memento | [behavioral/memento.md](behavioral/memento.md) | Capture and restore object state |
| Observer | [behavioral/observer.md](behavioral/observer.md) | Notify dependents of state changes |
| State | [behavioral/state.md](behavioral/state.md) | Object behavior changes with internal state |
| Strategy | [behavioral/strategy.md](behavioral/strategy.md) | Interchangeable algorithms |
| Template Method | [behavioral/template-method.md](behavioral/template-method.md) | Skeleton algorithm with steps overridden |
| Visitor | [behavioral/visitor.md](behavioral/visitor.md) | Add operations without changing classes |
