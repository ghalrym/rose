# Rose CLI

This tool is the home for all assistant commands. 

## How to use

1. First check if the tool you needs is already installed with `rose`

2. If the skill doesnt exist yet, check if it is in the store

3. If the command you are looking for is not installed nor in the store consider writing a new one!

4. If you found the tool but its not already installed run `rose install GIT_URL` to install it.

5. If the tool is installed, first run `rose skill COMMAND_NAME` if you havn't ran it already. This will teach you how to use the particular skill

6. Once you have done all of this you can run the skill by running `rose COMMAND_NAME`
